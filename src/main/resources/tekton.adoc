=== Tekton Pipeline



** Basic example: https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/guides/ci-cd/tekton-gs-p2/
** https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/tasks.md#substituting-workspace-paths
** Detaild example : https://github.com/IBM/tekton-tutorial

====
*** Must criteria: Minikube, OpenShift, Cloud must be up and running.
====

====
** Install Tekton
* kubectl apply --filename https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/latest/release.yaml
====

====
You can monitor the progress of the install by watching the pods in the newly created tekton-pipelines namespace:

* kubectl get pods -namespace tekton-pipelines --watch
====


Once the installation is complete, you’ll see two newly created pods:

tekton-pipelines-webhook-69796f78cf-b28z4      1/1     Running             0          9s
tekton-pipelines-controller-6d55778887-df59t   1/1     Running             0         12s

=== Tekton CLI
* For : Linux AMD 64
=====
# Get the tar.xz
curl -LO https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/releases/download/v0.11.0/tkn_0.11.0_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
# Extract tkn to your PATH (e.g. /usr/local/bin)
sudo tar xvzf tkn_0.11.0_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin/ tkn
=====

#DockerHub  (To push the stuff to DockerHub.) i.e pushing up container images to Docker Hub
* kubectl create secret docker-registry dockercreds --docker-server=https://index.docker.io/v1/ --docker-username=<DOCKERHUB_USERNAME> --docker-password=<DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD> --docker-email <DOCKERHUB_EMAIL>

Tekton consist of following entities.

    * Task
        https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/tasks.md

        A Task defines a set of build steps such as compiling code, running tests, and building and deploying images.
        Task is the most basic building block of a CI/CD pipeline.
        Is responsible for running a series of steps as part of a
        given CI/CD workflow. It will define `Inputs`, `Outputs`, and `Steps` for a given “Task”.
        These are then consumed in TaskRun or Pipeline resources, where we can connect Task resources.
        Task resources can be made to have shared volumes, which are mounted
        into the running Pod during a TaskRun.
        Enabling content that is produced between steps to be easily accessible.
        Each task runs in its own container.

    * Pipeline

        A Pipeline defines the set of Tasks that compose a pipeline.
        Enables the representation of  dependency structures of Task resources.

    * PipelineResource
        Is used to model and interact with external entities such as Git repositories, image registries, pull requests, and cloud storage. PipelineResources are used as inputs to and outputs from Tasks.

    * TaskRun
        In order to run the task, we need another resource called as TaskRun. It defines how to run a specific Tasks defined in the steps.
        i.e Will result in a defined Task resources being run in their defined containers within a singular Pod resource.

    * PipelineRun
        A PipelineRun defines an execution of a pipeline. It references the Pipeline to run and the PipelineResources to use as inputs and outputs.
        Facilitates the actual running of a defined Pipeline and its corresponding graph of Task resources, in the required ordering.

    ==TODO
    * Workspace support in Tekton 0.10 simplifies sharing files and artifacts between tasks in a pipeline, such as passing a JAR file from one task to another, or caching build dependencies
